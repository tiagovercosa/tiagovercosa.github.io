👋🏼 Hello!

I am Tiago. I hold a bachelor’s degree in Physics and a master’s degree in Applied Physics from the Federal Rural University of Pernambuco ([UFRPE](https://portal.ufrpe.br/)). I am currently a PhD candidate in Physics at the University of Brasília ([UnB](https://www.unb.br/)), Brazil. My research focuses on molecular dynamics (MD) and density functional theory (DFT), with applications to the study of nanomaterials.

I am a member of the Laboratory for Computational Materials Science ([LCCMat](https://lccmat.unb.br/)), a high-performance computing infrastructure dedicated to the simulation and characterization of nanomaterials and biomaterials.

Recently, I have been gradually reducing my activity on traditional social networks, opting instead for the calm of blogs, where I can read content that truly adds value, along with a few short posts on [Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@vercosa).

I am an enthusiast of knowledge management systems, particularly the concept of a “Second Brain”, and I seek to organize and manage my day-to-day activities using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md), with a strong focus on enhancing research productivity.
